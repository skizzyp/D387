The purpose of this project is to create a mock hotel application allowing room booking.

Everything is written in Java.  The application utilizes a Spring back-end and Angular front end.  

This application demonstrates multithreading for both English and French languages.  It also incorporates time zone conversions for three different time zones (MST, EST, and UTC).
